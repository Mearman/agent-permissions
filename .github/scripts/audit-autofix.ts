// pnpm 11.0.9 only honoured override selectors written to package.json's `pnpm.overrides` field; pnpm 11.21.0 flipped this -- it now silently ignores that field (a warning, not an error, so nothing failed loudly) and only reads `overrides:` from pnpm-workspace.yaml, confirmed empirically against both versions. Also confirmed empirically: adding a new override for a package that already has a resolved lockfile entry does NOT get applied by an incremental `pnpm install`, even with `--force` or `pnpm dedupe` — only deleting pnpm-lock.yaml and letting pnpm regenerate it from scratch reliably re-resolves against the new override. minimumReleaseAge still gates that fresh resolution, so this doesn't reopen the grace period for the packages actually being fixed; it does mean every other dependency can also drift to a newer in-range, aged version on a fix run, which `check` and `test` still gate as usual afterwards.
